## Introduction

The Source Sorting algorithm efficiently sorts arrays of integers and floats. Users can choose to input data manually or use provided sample data for demonstration.

## Compilation and Execution

1. **Compile the Program:**
   - Open a terminal in the project directory.
   - Compile the program using a C++ compiler, for example, `g++`:
     ```bash
     g++ main.cpp -o source_sorting
     ```

2. **Run the Program:**
   - Execute the compiled program:
     ```bash
     ./source_sorting
     ```

## Usage

Upon running the program, users will be prompted to choose whether to input data manually or use the provided sample data. Follow the instructions to enter integer and float elements.

### Manual Input

If the user chooses to input data manually, they will be prompted to enter integer elements until a non-integer is provided. After that, they will be prompted to enter float elements until a non-float is provided.

### Sample Data

If the user chooses to use sample data, the program will use pre-filled arrays of integers and floats for demonstration purposes.

## Example Output

- **Unsorted Integer Array:** `<array elements>`
- **Sorted Integer Array using Source Sorting:** `<sorted array elements>`

- **Unsorted Float Array:** `<array elements>`
- **Sorted Float Array using Source Sorting:** `<sorted array elements>`
